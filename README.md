# SiliconValleyForecast
Silicon Valley weather forecast extracted/scrapped from the National Weather Service.

Clone/Download the repository and run using
`python3 Silicon*.py`

and you can see the same forecast as it is here https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=37.37&lon=-122.04


BTW, this was just my practice of scrapping using python.

If want to do the same thing using NodeJS : https://blog.bitsrc.io/https-blog-bitsrc-io-how-to-perform-web-scraping-using-node-js-5a96203cb7cb
